/*
Lines 9â€“11 initialize the three variables. Line 12 prints out the values assigned to the variables.
Because the value of x is 7 and the value of y is 25, y is greater than x. Therefore, line 13 prints out 0, which is the result yielded by the relational expression x >= y.
Likewise, in line 14, the relational expression x == y yields 0.
Lines 15 and 16 print out the result of 1,which is yielded by the evaluations of both
x < zandy > z.
The statement in line 17 displays 0, which is the result of the relational expression
x != y - 18.Sincey - 18yields7,andthevalueofxis7,the!=relationshipdoes not hold. In line 18, the expression x + y != z produces 1, which is displayed on the screen.
