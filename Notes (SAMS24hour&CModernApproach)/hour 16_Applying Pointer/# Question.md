# Question

look @multidim_to_function.c ...when declare ptr_int to the memory address first elemen of multidimensional array why using &list[0][0] instead of just list?

# Answer

In C, when you use the name of an array (like `list` in this case), it typically decays into a pointer to its first element. However, for a multidimensional array, the behavior can be a bit different due to how the data is organized in memory.

1. **Using `list`**: When you use `list` by itself, it refers to the entire array, and its type is `int (*)[5]`, which means it's a pointer to an array of 5 integers. You cannot directly use `list` to access the individual integers in the way you want for functions that expect a pointer to a single integer.

2. **Using `&list[0][0]`**: The expression `&list[0][0]` explicitly gets the address of the first element of the first row of the array. The type of `&list[0][0]` is `int*`, which is what the function `DataAdd2` expects.

In summary, you use `&list[0][0]` to get the correct type of pointer (to an `int`) when passing it to `DataAdd2`, while using just `list` would not provide the right pointer type for that function.

# Question

please clarify,so when only 1D array it is oke to use the array name because it is only get memory address of first elemen but for greater than 1D array cannot like that because of?

# Answer

Yes, you're on the right track. Let's clarify it further:

1. **1D Arrays**: When you have a one-dimensional array, using the array name itself (e.g., `array`) gives you a pointer to the first element. For example, if you have:

   ```c
   int array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   ```

   Using just `array` in a function call will pass a pointer of type `int*`, which is exactly what you need to work with the elements of the array.

2. **Multidimensional Arrays**: For a multidimensional array, the situation changes. Let's consider a two-dimensional array:

   ```c
   int list[2][5] = { ... };
   ```

   Here, using `list` by itself gives you a pointer to the first element of the array, which is of type `int (*)[5]`. This type represents a pointer to an array of 5 integers, not a pointer to a single integer.

   If you want to pass a pointer that points to the first individual integer in the array (which is what `DataAdd2` expects), you use `&list[0][0]`. This gives you a pointer of type `int*`, which is suitable for the function that operates on single integers.

### Summary:

- **1D Array**: The name of the array decays to a pointer to its first element (`int*`).
- **Multidimensional Array**: The name decays to a pointer to its first row (e.g., `int (*)[5]` for a 2D array), so you must explicitly use `&list[0][0]` to get a pointer to a single element (`int*`).

This distinction is why you cannot use just the array name for multidimensional arrays when you need a pointer to an individual element.
